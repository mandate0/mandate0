### EEOC FAQ
 
* [Questions and Answers: Religious Discrimination in the Workplace](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/questions-and-answers-religious-discrimination-workplace)
 
**1. What is “religion” under Title VII?**
 
Title VII protects all aspects of religious observance and practice as well as belief and defines religion very broadly for purposes of determining what the law covers. For purposes of Title VII, religion includes not only traditional, organized religions [such as …] but also religious beliefs that are new, uncommon, not part of a formal church or sect, only subscribed to by a small number of people, or that seem illogical or unreasonable to others. An employee’s belief or practice can be “religious” under Title VII even if the employee is affiliated with a religious group that does not espouse or recognize that individual’s belief or practice, or if few – or no – other people adhere to it. Title VII’s protections also extend to those who are discriminated against or need accommodation because they profess no religious beliefs.
 
Religious beliefs include theistic beliefs […] as well as non-theistic “moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views.” Although courts generally resolve doubts […], beliefs are not protected merely because they are strongly held. Rather, religion typically concerns “ultimate ideas” about “life, purpose, and death.”
 
Religious observances or practices include, for example, […] or other forms of religious expression, or refraining from certain activities.
 
**4. What constitutes religious harassment under Title VII?**
 
Religious harassment in violation of Title VII occurs when employees are: (1) required or coerced to abandon, alter, or adopt a religious practice as a condition of employment (this type of “quid pro quo” harassment may also give rise to a disparate treatment or denial of accommodation claim in some circumstances);
 
**6. When does Title VII require an employer to accommodate an applicant or employee’s religious belief, practice, or observance?**
 
Title VII requires an employer, once on notice that a religious accommodation is needed, to reasonably accommodate an employee whose sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance conflicts with a work requirement, unless doing so would pose an undue hardship. Under Title VII, the undue hardship defense to providing religious accommodation requires a showing that the proposed accommodation in a particular case poses a “more than de minimis” cost or burden.
 
**7. How does an employer learn that accommodation may be needed?**
 
An applicant or employee who seeks religious accommodation must make the employer aware both of the need for accommodation and that it is being requested due to a conflict between religion and work.
 
**8. Does an employer have to grant every request for accommodation of a religious belief or practice?**
 
No. […] only those religious beliefs that are religious and “sincerely held,” and that can be accommodated without an undue hardship. Although there is usually no reason to question whether the practice at issue is religious or sincerely held, if the employer has a bona fide doubt about the basis for the accommodation request, it is entitled to make a limited inquiry into the facts and circumstances of the employee’s claim that the belief or practice at issue is religious and sincerely held, and gives rise to the need for the accommodation.
 
Factors that – either alone or in combination – might undermine an employee’s assertion that he sincerely holds the religious belief at issue include: whether the employee has behaved in a manner markedly inconsistent with the professed belief; whether the accommodation sought is a particularly desirable benefit that is likely to be sought for secular reasons; whether the timing of the request renders it suspect (e.g., it follows an earlier request by the employee for the same benefit for secular reasons); and whether the employer otherwise has reason to believe the accommodation is not sought for religious reasons.
 
However, none of these factors is dispositive. For example, although prior inconsistent conduct is relevant to the question of sincerity, an individual’s beliefs – or degree of adherence – may change over time, and therefore an employee’s newly adopted or inconsistently observed religious practice may nevertheless be sincerely held. An employer also should not assume that an employee is insincere simply because some of his or her practices deviate from the commonly followed tenets of his or her religion.
 
**9. When does an accommodation pose an “undue hardship”?**
 
An accommodation would pose an undue hardship if it –would cause more than de minimis cost on the operation of the employer’s business. Factors relevant to undue hardship may include the type of workplace, the nature of the employee’s duties, the identifiable cost of the accommodation in relation to the size and operating costs of the employer, and the number of employees who will in fact need a particular accommodation.
 
Costs to be considered include not only direct monetary costs but also the burden on the conduct of the employer’s business. For example, courts have found undue hardship where the accommodation diminishes efficiency in other jobs, infringes on other employees’ job rights or benefits, impairs workplace safety, or causes co-workers to carry the accommodated employee’s share of potentially hazardous or burdensome work. Whether the proposed accommodation conflicts with another law will also be considered.
 
To prove undue hardship, the employer will need to demonstrate how much cost or disruption a proposed accommodation would involve. An employer cannot rely on potential or hypothetical hardship when faced with a religious obligation that conflicts with scheduled work, but rather should rely on objective information. A mere assumption that many more people with the same religious practices as the individual being accommodated may also seek accommodation is not evidence of undue hardship.
 
If an employee’s proposed accommodation would pose an undue hardship, the employer should explore alternative accommodations.
 
**11. What if co-workers complain about an employee being granted an accommodation?**
 
[…], general disgruntlement, resentment, or jealousy of co-workers will not [be considered undue hardship]. Undue hardship requires more than proof that some co-workers complained; a showing of undue hardship based on co-worker interests generally requires evidence that the accommodation would actually infringe on the rights of co-workers or cause disruption of work.
 
**16. Does Title VII prohibit retaliation?**
 
Yes. Title VII prohibits retaliation by an employer, employment agency, or labor organization because an individual has engaged in protected activity.
 
**18. What should an applicant or employee do if he believes he has experienced religious discrimination?**
 
Employees or job applicants should attempt to address concerns with the alleged offender […]. They should keep records documenting what they experienced or witnessed, as well as other witness names, […]. Employees may file a charge with the EEOC, and are legally protected from being punished for reporting or opposing job discrimination or for participating in an EEOC investigation. Charges against private sector and local and state government employers […] by contacting the nearest EEOC office.

### EEOC FAQ (COVID version updated 10/25/21)

* [What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Laws ](https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws)


**A.6. May an employer administer a COVID-19 test (a test to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus) when evaluating an employee’s initial or continued presence in the workplace?**

The ADA requires that any mandatory medical test of employees be “job related and consistent with business necessity.”

**A.8. May employers ask all employees physically entering the workplace if they have been diagnosed with or tested for COVID-19? (9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 1)**

Yes. Employers may ask all employees who will be physically entering the workplace if they have COVID-19 or symptoms associated with COVID-19, and ask if they have been tested for COVID-19. [...]

An employer may exclude those with COVID-19, or symptoms associated with COVID-19, from the workplace because, [...]. However, for those employees who are teleworking and are not physically interacting with coworkers or others (for example, customers), the employer would generally not be permitted to ask these questions.

**A.11. What may an employer do under the ADA if an employee refuses to permit the employer to take his temperature or refuses to answer questions about whether he has COVID-19, has symptoms associated with COVID-19, or has been tested for COVID-19? (9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 2)**

Under the circumstances existing currently, the ADA allows an employer to bar an employee from physical presence in the workplace if he refuses to have his temperature taken or refuses to answer questions about whether he has COVID-19, has symptoms associated with COVID-19, or has been tested for COVID-19. [...] Sometimes, employees are reluctant to provide medical information because they fear an employer may widely spread such personal medical information throughout the workplace. The ADA prohibits such broad disclosures. Alternatively, if an employee requests reasonable accommodation with respect to screening, the usual accommodation process should be followed; this is discussed in Question G.7.

**B.3. May an employer disclose the name of an employee to a public health agency when it learns that the employee has COVID-19? (4/9/20)**

Yes.

**B.8. Many employees, including managers and supervisors, are now teleworking as a result of COVID-19. How are they supposed to keep medical information of employees confidential while working remotely? (9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 9)**

The ADA requirement that medical information be kept confidential includes a requirement that it be stored separately from regular personnel files. If a manager or supervisor receives medical information involving COVID-19, or any other medical information, while teleworking, and is able to follow an employer’s existing confidentiality protocols while working remotely, the supervisor has to do so. But to the extent that is not feasible, the supervisor still must safeguard this information to the greatest extent possible until the supervisor can properly store it. This means that paper notepads, laptops, or other devices should not be left where others can access the protected information.

Similarly, documentation must not be stored electronically where others would have access. A manager may even wish to use initials or another code to further ensure confidentiality of the name of an employee.

**E.2. Are there steps an employer should take to address possible harassment and discrimination against coworkers when it re-opens the workplace? (4/17/20)**

Yes. An employer may remind all employees that it is against the federal EEO laws to harass or otherwise discriminate against coworkers based on race, national origin, color, sex, religion, age (40 or over), disability, or genetic information. It may be particularly helpful for employers to advise supervisors and managers of their roles in watching for, stopping, and reporting any harassment or other discrimination. An employer may also make clear that it will immediately review any allegations of harassment or discrimination and take appropriate action.

**K.1.  Under the ADA, Title VII, and other federal employment nondiscrimination laws, may an employer require all employees physically entering the workplace to be vaccinated against COVID-19?    (Updated 10/13/21)**

In some circumstances, Title VII and the ADA require an employer to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who, because of a disability or a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance, do not get vaccinated against COVID-19, unless providing an accommodation would pose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer’s business.

[...]

It would also be unlawful to apply a vaccination requirement to employees in a way that treats employees differently based on disability, race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity), national origin, age, or genetic information, unless there is a legitimate non-discriminatory reason.

**K.2.   What are some examples of reasonable accommodations or modifications that employers may have to provide to employees who do not get vaccinated due to disability; religious beliefs, practices, or observance; or pregnancy?  (5/28/21)**

An employee who does not get vaccinated due to a disability (covered by the ADA) or a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance (covered by Title VII) may be entitled to a reasonable accommodation that does not pose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer’s business.  For example, as a reasonable accommodation, an unvaccinated employee entering the workplace might wear a face mask, work at a social distance from coworkers or non-employees, work a modified shift, get periodic tests for COVID-19, be given the opportunity to telework, or finally, accept a reassignment.

**K.12.  Under Title VII, how should an employer respond to an employee who communicates that he or she is unable to be vaccinated for COVID-19 (or provide documentation or other confirmation of vaccination) because of a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance? (Updated 5/28/21)**

Once an employer is on notice that an employee’s sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance prevents the employee from getting a COVID-19 vaccine, the employer must provide a reasonable accommodation unless it would pose an undue hardship. [...]

EEOC guidance explains that the definition of religion is broad and protects beliefs, practices, and observances with which the employer may be unfamiliar.  Therefore, the employer should ordinarily assume that an employee’s request for religious accommodation is based on a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance.  However, if an employee requests a religious accommodation, and an employer is aware of facts that provide an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, practice, or observance, the employer would be justified in requesting additional supporting information. See also 29 CFR 1605.

Under Title VII, an employer should thoroughly consider all possible reasonable accommodations, including telework and reassignment.

Under Title VII, courts define “undue hardship” as having more than minimal cost or burden on the employer.  This is an easier standard for employers to meet than the ADA’s undue hardship standard, which applies to requests for accommodations due to a disability.  Considerations relevant to undue hardship can include, among other things, the proportion of employees in the workplace who already are partially or fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and the extent of employee contact with non-employees, whose vaccination status could be unknown or who may be ineligible for the vaccine.  Ultimately, if an employee cannot be accommodated, employers should determine if any other rights apply under the EEO laws or other federal, state, and local orities before taking adverse employment action against an unvaccinated employee

**L.1. Do employees who have a religious objection to receiving a COVID-19 vaccination need to tell their employer?  If so, is there specific language that must be used under Title VII? (10/25/21)**

Employees must tell their employer if they are requesting an exception to a COVID-19 vaccination requirement because of a conflict between that requirement and their sincerely held religious beliefs, practices, or observances [...]

When making the request, employees do not need to use any “magic words,” [...] However, they need to notify the employer that there is a conflict between their sincerely held religious beliefs and the employer’s COVID-19 vaccination requirement.

**L.2. Does an employer have to accept an employee’s assertion of a religious objection to a COVID-19 vaccination at face value?  May the employer ask for additional information? (10/25/21)**

Generally, under Title VII, an employer should assume that a request for religious accommodation is based on sincerely held religious beliefs.  However, if an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, the employer would be justified in making a limited factual inquiry and seeking additional supporting information.  [...]

The definition of “religion” under Title VII protects nontraditional religious beliefs that may be unfamiliar to employers. [...] objections to COVID-19 vaccination that are based on social, political, or personal preferences, or on nonreligious concerns about the possible effects of the vaccine, do not qualify as “religious beliefs” under Title VII.

[...] Factors that – either alone or in combination – might undermine an employee’s credibility include:  whether the employee has acted in a manner inconsistent with the professed belief (although employees need not be scrupulous in their observance); whether the accommodation sought is a particularly desirable benefit that is likely to be sought for nonreligious reasons; whether the timing of the request renders it suspect (e.g., it follows an earlier request by the employee for the same benefit for secular reasons); and whether the employer otherwise has reason to believe the accommodation is not sought for religious reasons.

The employer may ask for an explanation of how the employee’s religious belief conflicts with the employer’s COVID-19 vaccination requirement.  Although prior inconsistent conduct is relevant to the question of sincerity, an individual’s beliefs – or degree of adherence – may change over time and, therefore, an employee’s newly adopted or inconsistently observed practices may nevertheless be sincerely held.  An employer should not assume that an employee is insincere simply because some of the employee’s practices deviate from the commonly followed tenets of the employee’s religion, or because the employee adheres to some common practices but not others.  No one factor or consideration is determinative, and employers should evaluate religious objections on an individual basis.

When an employee’s objection to a COVID-19 vaccination requirement is not religious in nature, or is not sincerely held, Title VII does not require the employer to provide an exception to the vaccination requirement as a religious accommodation.

**L.3. How does an employer show that it would be an “undue hardship” to accommodate an employee’s request for religious accommodation? (10/25/21)**

Under Title VII, an employer should thoroughly consider all possible reasonable accommodations, including telework and reassignment. [...]

An employer cannot rely on speculative hardships when faced with an employee’s religious objection but, rather, should rely on objective information.

### Covid and Coffee

These articles are written by a lawyer with a Christian view point.  While these may be considered helpful resources based on legal opinion, it should be noted that outcomes based on this guidance may vary.
 
#### Part 1:
 
* [Coffee & Covid ☙ Monday, October 11, 2021 ☙ COVID ULTIMATUM GUIDE](https://www.coffeeandcovid.com/p/-coffee-and-covid-monday-october-4e1)
 
Unless you have a solid financial reason, DO NOT QUIT.
 
All these employer policies are designed to convince you to resign. That’s the best-case scenario for the employer. It absolves them from liability. They’ll argue, who knows WHY the person quit? Could have been any reason. Uh-huh. I’ve seen memos stating that, “If you do not sign this acknowledgment [to inject], then you will be deemed to have resigned.” First of all, that’s bogus and unenforceable. Second, don’t sign it, and don’t resign.
 
Anything you send your employer in writing, in whatever form, should begin with the words, “I want to keep my job. I have been a loyal and productive employee here since [DATE].” If you’ve received honors, excellent performance reviews, awards, or the like, add a line mentioning those. REPEAT THIS STATEMENT EVERY SINGLE TIME you talk about the policy in writing. Let’s call this the “Job Affirmation Statement.”
 
**Example Job Affirmation Statement**
 
> First and foremost, I want you to know that I want to keep my job. I have been a loyal and productive employee here since November 2020.  Since joining [THE COMPANY] I have been recognized for my proactive collaboration across the enterprise; and most recently I have been awarded a [AWARD] in recognition of my performance.
 
Then for each response … (perhaps to add variety)
 
> Thank you for your speedy response.  I want to reiterate; I want to keep my job.  I sincerely enjoy the work I do here at [COMPANY] and I find great satisfaction helping our customers design and implement their [INDUSTRY] solutions.
 
Print every online form, FAQ, memorandum, etc. to PDF and save it to your evidence file.
 
BCC your own personal email account on all your communications with them. That way you'll have access to those emails even if your email account is unexpectedly closed down.
 
Documenting oral communications: After you have an oral conversation with a manager at your company about the policy, go right back to your workstation, and compose an email to that person. Here’s what to put in it:
 
1. Thank them and frame it as your professional attempt to make sure you understood everything (“Thanks for the informative conversation just now. I wanted to recap what we discussed to make sure I understood everything you said and didn’t miss anything.”) 
2. State the Job Affirmation Statement (“To be clear, I want to keep my job…”). 
3. Recap what they said. “As I recall, you said BLH BLAH BLAH.”
4. If it’s important, recap what YOU said: “I said, BLAH BLAH BLAH.” 
5. Ask for correction (“Please let me know ASAP if I’ve misunderstood anything, or left anything important out.”) 
6. Thank them again (“Thanks so much for taking the time to assist me with these difficult matters. I appreciate it very much.”)
 
Then print the email out to PDF and save it in your evidence locker. If they respond, add the response. Document EVERYTHING.
 
Let me [AUTHOR] be clear about something. There’s no such thing as a “religious exemption REQUEST.” You don’t have to REQUEST it. It’s the LAW. They have to accommodate your religious or moral beliefs. It’s the employer’s burden, not yours. All you have to do is NOTIFY THEM of your sincerely-held religious or moral beliefs. Stop thinking you have to beg for it.
 
Here’s what your sincerely-held moral or religious beliefs do NOT have to be:
 
* Religious. As I said, it doesn’t even have to be a religious belief, just a sincerely-held moral or ethical belief. 
* Consistent with previous actions, like other vaccines you might have taken. Doesn’t matter. 
* “[A]cceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] protection.” 
* Long-standing. Even newly-acquired beliefs are fine, so long as they are sincerely-held. Go get baptized. It’s time you did it anyway. A good church will provide you with a social safety net, worst come to worst. 
* Consistent with generally accepted tenets of your religious denomination (“we reject the notion that to claim the protection, one must be responding to the commands of a particular religious organization”).
 
If you can get them to say something anti-religious in an email, that is legal GOLD. So let your religious and moral beliefs shine. Talk about them a LOT.
 
If your employer rejects your religious exemption “request,” send this email to HR:
 
> “[JOB AFFIRMATION STATEMENT]. But I was confused just now when I received this notification that you are ‘rejecting’ my religious beliefs. That makes no sense to me. My religious beliefs are deeply-held and I do not recognize your authority to reject them. To be clear, I have notified you of my sincerely held religious beliefs. I expect you to accommodate them. Please govern yourself accordingly.”
 
#### Part 2:

* [PRIMER ON RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION REQUESTS](https://www.coffeeandcovid.com/p/primer-on-religious-exemption-requests-f31)
 
[T]he first principle you need to know is that a qualifying sincerely-held religious belief can be recently acquired. 
 
Next, you don’t have to be devout or even openly religious. The law is clear that a sincere religious believer doesn’t forfeit his religious rights merely because he is not scrupulous in his observance or had never openly demonstrated those beliefs in the past.
 
[When submitting your notification,] Even though you aren’t required to have been actively religious, if you have been, tell them.
 
* You don’t have to cite ANY scripture.
* You DON’T need a note from a pastor.
* Do NOT try to be an armchair theologian
* [...] in no way are religious rights and liberties limited to Christianity
 
[H]ow to handle the inevitable HR meeting
 
* Be confident and upbeat.
* Emphasize the sincere and unwavering nature of your religious belief.
* Don’t let them talk you out of your sincerely-held belief with facts. Truth or falsity of the belief isn’t the issue when it comes to spirituality. […] Beliefs aren’t things that CAN be proven true or false.
* Don’t engage in theological debates with anyone. Agree to disagree. THEIR beliefs are irrelevant. It’s YOUR beliefs that matter.
* If your belief is newly-acquired, admit it. Just stress how sincerely held it is.
* Always remember that the interview is being held to gather evidence to defend your employer against a subsequent lawsuit for religious discrimination. It’s not about the form, or “approving” your request. They aren’t trying to help you. So pick your words carefully, thoughtfully, and don’t talk too much.
* Tell the truth.
 
#### Part 3:
 
* [SECOND RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION PRIMER—A Full Example](https://www.coffeeandcovid.com/p/-second-religious-accommodation-primera)
 
The most important thing is that your belief — the specific belief that precludes your participation in the Covid-19 injections — must be SINCERELY HELD. So, two elements: specific and sincerely held.

[After reading] This was when I first discovered that the development and testing of the Covid-19 vaccines required tissues from aborted children. While these baby parts were not later used in the manufacturing of the drugs, it was a profound shock that they were involved in the drugs at all. I had not heard that before, in all the media reports about the drugs.

**Responses to Specific Questions**

“Do your religious belief(s) prevent you from receiving any other vaccine(s), or is your objection limited to the COVID-19 vaccine? If limited to the COVID-19 vaccine, please explain why. Please explain, in detail, and identify any other vaccine(s) you have taken, such as the flu or tetanus vaccines and the dates of same.”
 
Example 1:
 
I generally [do or do not] take vaccines, but I did have childhood vaccines and took the flu vaccine once or twice in my early 20’s. I don’t think I’ve had any vaccines since I was saved, but to be honest, it was the Covid research that I described in my letter (see Question No. 1) that alerted me to the use of aborted baby tissue in the development of many vaccines. I won’t be taking any vaccines in that category, nor will my children.
 
 
### Liberty Counsel
 
* [LEGAL HELP FOR RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS FROM VACCINATIONS](https://lc.org/exempt)

An employer CAN question the employee’s belief to find out if they are SINCERE, meaning they’re not merely using religion as a basis for their request just to avoid the COVID shots. The employer can ask WHAT they believe, WHY they believe it, HOW it affects their life decisions and their decision regarding the COVID shots. An employer CANNOT question the validity or correctness of religious beliefs. The employer CANNOT ask why the employee is interpreting a Scripture in a particular way, or why the employee objects to the COVID shot when others in their church or religious order either have no position or even support the shots.

* [Memo Sample  Religious Exemption Requests](https://lc.org/Site%20Images/Resources/Memo-SampleCOVID-ReligiousExemptionRequests-07262021.pdf)
 
In order for an employee or student to prevail under a claim for a religious exemption, whether based on pro-life or other religious beliefs, religious beliefs must be sincerely held, and the requested accommodation must be “reasonable,” and not constitute an undue hardship on the employer or institution.

The manner in which the employer or institution continued its operations in 2020, prior to the availability of the COVID shots, establishes a baseline of treatment of employees or students that is not an “undue hardship.” It will NEVER be an “undue hardship” for the entity to allow the employee or student to continue doing what was considered “safe and effective” or “mitigating” in the absence of the vaccine. However, such treatment may become discriminatory, if novel or additional restrictions or requirements are applied to the person who should otherwise be exempt. If the COVID shots work, those people who have received them are protected, and it is not an undue hardship for individuals who have religious objections to not receive such shots.

> "If an employee cannot get vaccinated because of a disability or sincerely held religious belief, and there is no reasonable accommodation possible, an employer could exclude the employee from physically entering the workplace," said Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., SHRM-SCP, the Society for Human Resource Management's president and chief executive officer. "But this doesn't mean an individual can be automatically terminated. Employers will need to determine if any other rights apply under the EEO laws or other federal, state and local authorities."

It is true that decades ago, scientists decided to use fetal tissue to start the cell lines we use to test drugs today.
 
Fetal cell lines are cells that grow in a laboratory. They descend from cells taken from abortions in the 1970s and 1980s
 
When it comes to the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, fetal cell line HEK 293 was used during the research and development phase. All HEK 293 cells are descended from tissue taken from a 1973 abortion that took place in the Netherlands.
 
For the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, fetal cell lines were used in the production and manufacturing stage.  To make the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, scientists infect PER.C6 fetal cell lines to grow the adenovirus vector.  […] All PER.C6 cells used to manufacture the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are descended from tissue taken from a 1985 abortion that took place in the Netherlands.
 
### Case Law:

#### EEOC v. Ilona of Hungary, Inc., 108 F.3d 1569, 1575 (7th Cir. 1997)

* https://www.leagle.com/decision/19971677108rf3d156911660
 
the court found that a Jewish employee had proved her request for leave on Yom Kippur was based on a sincerely held religious belief, even though she had never in her prior eight-year tenure sought leave from work for a religious observance, had even conceded that she generally was not a very religious person, but the evidence showed that the recent birth of her son and the death of her father had strengthened her religious beliefs.
 
#### Hammerhead Enterprises, Inc. v. Brezenoff, 707 F. 2d 33 (2d. Cir. 1983)

The government can’t do something THROUGH a private actor that it would be illegal to do directly. See, e.g., Hammerhead Enterprises, Inc. v. Brezenoff, 707 F. 2d 33 (2d. Cir. 1983) (“Where comments of a government official can reasonably be interpreted as intimating that some form of punishment or adverse regulatory action will follow the failure to accede to the official’s request, a valid claim can be stated.”)

#### Anderson v. U.S.F. Logistics (IMC), Inc., 274 F.3d 470, 475 (7th Cir. 2001)

In Anderson v. U.S.F. Logistics (IMC), Inc., 274 F.3d 470, 475 (7th Cir. 2001), the court held that an employer could not stop an employee from using the phrase “Have a Blessed Day” as a greeting in her work emails, even if the use of the phrase was not expressly required by her religion (Christian Methodist Episcopal) and was totally unique to her.

[T]o restrict the act to those practices which are mandated or prohibited by a tenet of the religion, would involve the court in determining not only what are the tenets of a particular religion, . . . but would frequently require the courts to decide whether a particular practice is or is not required by the tenets of the religion […] [S]uch a judicial determination [would] be irreconcilable with the warning issued by the Supreme Court in Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U.S 67 (1953) ‘[I]t is no business of courts to say […] what is a religious practice or activity

intrafaith differences of that kind are not uncommon among followers of a particular creed . . . and the guarantee of free exercise is not limited to beliefs which are shared by all of the members of a religious sect

### Questions related to the mandate that you can ask of your employer:
 
* Are there any known side effects from the vaccine?
* How does the company plan on addressing injuries from the vaccine?  given that there are a lot more data showing that 90% of the hospitalizations are coming from the vaccinated, the vx does not prevent infection, the vx has injured thousands of people.
* Does the company health insurance policy cover any conditions (both near or long term) that may arise from the vaccine?
* Does the company life insurance policy cover my death as a result of an adverse reaction to this vaccination?
* I notice that the form for requesting a religious accommodation asks me how long I’ve held my belief.  If my belief is new, does that disqualify me from an accommodation?
* I notice that the form for requesting a religious accommodation asks me if I’ve ever had a vaccine as an adult.  If I have, does that disqualify me from an accommodation?
* I notice that the form for requesting a religious accommodation asks me if I have any objections to any other medications.  Does that mean I have to research all other medications that might possibly conflict with my religious belief?  What if I don’t want to disclose other medications that I’m taking?
* If I take the vaccine does that mean I can no longer contract or transmit COVID?
* What happens if I don't comply with this mandate?
